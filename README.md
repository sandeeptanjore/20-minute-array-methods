# 20-Minute Array Methods Challenge

A daily practice repository for mastering JavaScript's essential array methods through hands-on exercises. 
This challenge, created by Travis Rodgers, is designed to build proficiency and fluency in manipulating arrays.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains my solutions to a series of daily programming exercises. Each day focuses on different JavaScript array methods, reinforcing key concepts through practical application.

## 📋 Challenge Progress

**Note:** The original challenge series did not include exercises for Day 5, Day 7, and Day 8.

## 🛠️ Array Methods Covered

- **`forEach()`** - Execute a function for each element
- **`map()`** - Transform each element to create a new array
- **`filter()`** - Select elements that meet a condition
- **`find()`** - Find the first element that meets a condition
- **`some()`** - Check if at least one element meets a condition
- **`every()`** - Check if all elements meet a condition
- **`reduce()`** - Reduce an array to a single value

## 🎯 My Goals

- Solidify understanding of JavaScript array methods
- Develop problem-solving skills through daily practice
- Build a consistent coding habit
- Create a portfolio of solved challenges
